iv. unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
x. for shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
xiii. o, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
xxvi. lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
xl. take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
li. thus can my love excuse the slow offence
lvi. sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
lxii. sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
lxiii. against my love shall be, as i am now,
xcv. how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
cii. my love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
cv. let not my love be call'd idolatry,
cxii. your love and pity doth the impression fill
cxxiv. if my dear love were but the child of state,
cxxvi. o thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
cxxxii. thine eyes i love, and they, as pitying me,
cxxxvii. thou blind fool, love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
cxxxviii. when my love swears that she is made of truth
cxli. in faith, i do not love thee with mine eyes,
cxlii. love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,
cxliv. two loves i have of comfort and despair,
cxlv. those lips that love's own hand did make
cxlvii. my love is as a fever, longing still
cxlviii. o me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
cxlix. canst thou, o cruel! say i love thee not,
cli. love is too young to know what conscience is;
cliv. the little love-god lying once asleep
